       # ... customize as needed
     }
   }
   ```

   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The landing zone module creates the following AWS resources:

### Core Components
- **AWS Organizations**: Root organization with OUs
- **AWS Control Tower**: Landing zone with governance
- **Account Structure**: Automated account creation
- **IAM Roles**: Control Tower service roles
- **Backup Configuration**: Cross-account backup policies

### Organizational Units (OUs)
```
Root Organization
├── Security Account (mandatory)
├── Logging Account (mandatory)
├── Suspended OU
├── Common Services OU
│   ├── Backups Account
│   └── Custom Service Accounts
└── Workloads OU
    ├── Production OU
    ├── Staging OU
    └── Development OU
```

### Account Types

| Account Type | Purpose | Examples |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Management** | Root account for billing and organization management | (Your existing account) |
| **Security** | Centralized security and audit logging | AWS Config, Security Hub |
| **Logging** | Centralized logging and CloudTrail | CloudTrail, Access Logs |
| **Backups** | Cross-account backup management | AWS Backup policies |
| **Workload** | Application and service accounts | Production, Staging, Development |
| **Common Services** | Shared infrastructure services | Networking, DNS, Monitoring |

## 📋 Configuration Reference

### Required Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `email_domain` | Domain for account emails | `"company.com"` |
| `region` | Primary AWS region | `"us-east-1"` |

### Optional Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `backup_region` | Secondary region for backups | `"us-west-2"` |
| `governed_regions` | Control Tower managed regions | `["us-east-1"]` |
| `email_local_part` | Email prefix | `"aws"` |
| `org_accounts` | Account structure definition | See examples |
| `tags` | Resource tags | Basic tags |

### Email Configuration

Accounts are created with emails in the format:
```
{email_local_part}+{account-name}@{email_domain}
```

Examples:
- `aws+prod-web-services@company.com`
- `aws+security@company.com`
- `aws+logging@company.com`

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### 1. **Least Privilege Access**
- Use specific IAM roles for Terragrunt execution
- Implement proper assume role chains
- Regular access reviews

### 2. **State File Security**
- Encrypt state files at rest and in transit
- Use separate state buckets per environment
- Implement proper access controls on state buckets

### 3. **Network Security**
- Deploy in private subnets when possible
- Use VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Implement proper security group rules

### 4. **Compliance and Governance**
- Implement comprehensive tagging strategies
- Use AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- Regular security assessments

### 5. **Backup and Recovery**
- Cross-region backup replication
- Regular backup testing
- Documented recovery procedures

## 🏷️ Tagging Strategy

### Required Tags
- `Owner`: Resource owner
- `Environment`: Environment type (prod, staging, dev)
- `CostCenter`: Cost allocation
- `Provisioned by`: Terraform/Terragrunt

### Recommended Tags
- `Project`: Project identifier
- `DataClass`: Data classification level
- `Backup`: Backup requirement flag
- `Monitoring`: Monitoring level
- `Compliance`: Compliance requirements

### Example Tagging Configuration
```hcl
tags = {
  # Basic information
  "Owner"           = "Platform Team"
  "Environment"     = "Production"
  "CostCenter"      = "Infrastructure"
  "Provisioned by"  = "Terraform"
  
  # Governance
  "Project"         = "Landing Zone"
  "DataClass"       = "Internal"
  "Backup"          = "true"
  "Monitoring"      = "Enhanced"
  
  # Compliance
  "SecurityLevel"   = "High"
  "Compliance"      = "SOC2,ISO27001"
  
  # Contact
  "TechnicalOwner"  = "platform-team@company.com"
}
```

## 🚨 Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### 1. **Control Tower Prerequisites**
**Error**: Control Tower deployment fails
**Solution**: Ensure your management account meets all Control Tower prerequisites:
- No existing Control Tower deployment
- Proper IAM permissions
- Account in good standing

### 2. **Email Domain Issues**
**Error**: Account creation fails due to email conflicts
**Solution**: 
- Use a dedicated subdomain for AWS accounts
- Ensure email routing is configured properly
- Avoid using existing email addresses

### 3. **Regional Limitations**
**Error**: Service not available in selected region
**Solution**: 
- Verify Control Tower regional availability
- Use supported regions for governed_regions
- Check service availability in target regions

### 4. **State File Conflicts**
**Error**: State locking errors
**Solution**:
- Ensure DynamoDB table exists and is accessible
- Use unique state keys for different deployments
- Implement proper IAM permissions for state access

### 5. **Large Deployment Timeouts**
**Error**: Terraform timeouts during large deployments
**Solution**:
- Increase terraform timeout values
- Deploy in phases (core first, then workloads)
- Use depends_on properly to manage resource order
